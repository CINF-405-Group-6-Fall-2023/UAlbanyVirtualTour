<h3> Welcome </h3>
  <p> For over 50 years, the UAlbany Performing Arts Center (UAlbany PAC) has been a "jewel in the crown" of the University at Albany and an important 
  resource for the entire Capital Region community. Each year, the Prime Performance Series welcomes an array of national and international touring artists in
  music, dance and theatre. The Department of Music and Theatre presents approximately 40-50 concerts and three to four productions. A bustling hub of artistic
  activity, the UAlbany PAC boasts five unique performance theatres plus a dance studio, band/choral rehearsal rooms, scene/costume shops and both music and 
  theatre libraries. </p>
