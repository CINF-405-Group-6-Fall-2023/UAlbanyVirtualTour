            <h3>Quick Glance</h3>
            <p>John Fallon Field, the home for UAlbany men's and women's lacrosse, was completed in the fall of 2005.  Fallon, a former UAlbany student-athlete, and a partner at Kay Scholer LLP in New York City, made a significant contribution to fund the construction of the all-weather turf field with permanent stands and press box. John Fallon Field is available to rent to non-commercial entities for lacrosse and field hockey games and practices at an hourly rate.</p>
