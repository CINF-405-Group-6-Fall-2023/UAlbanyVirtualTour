            <h3>Quick Glance</h3>
            <p>The new track and field venue, located adjacent to the Physical Education building in the site of former University Field, has a 9-lane IAAF certified track. The surface is Olympic-caliber Beynon BSS 2000 that features a force reduction layer of butyl rubber and full-depth color Polyurethane. There is a natural turf infield that includes a throws area as well as an irrigation system. There is also a separate hammer throw area adjacent to the venue. The venue, which is used strictly for track and field activities, was completed in the fall of 2013.</p>
