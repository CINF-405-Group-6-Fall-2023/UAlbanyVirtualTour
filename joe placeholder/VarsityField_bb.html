            <h3>Quick Glance</h3>
            <p>Varsity Field has served as the University at Albany's on-campus baseball stadium for more than 30 years. The facility has been used throughout the program's transition from the NCAA Division III level to its present Division I affiliation. On March 24, 2000, Varsity Field hosted the school's first-ever Division I baseball contest, when the Great Danes defeated Canisius, 9-1. The Baseball Great Danes compete in the America East conference. Varsity Field is available to rent to non-commercial entities for games and practices at an hourly rate</p>
