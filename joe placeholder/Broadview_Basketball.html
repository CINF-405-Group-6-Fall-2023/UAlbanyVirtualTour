            <h3>Quick Glance</h3>
            <p>In the spring of 1992, the University at Albany opened the SEFCU Arena, an $11 million state-of-the-art facility.  
The SEFCU Arena is the home for UAlbany's men's and women's basketball teams, and has an .11 mile indoor track.  
The arena also serves as a major venue of community events such as concerts, sporting events and University activities. 
In 2017, the University at Albany has unveiled a new video scoreboard in SEFCU Arena that was made possible by a $1 million donation from Ed Swyer and Stuyvesant Plaza. 
The new board, which hangs above center court, will provide an video feed of the game, in-game statistics, and replay for the men's and women's basketball games. 
The SEFCU Arena is available to rent to non-commercial entities for special events, games and practices.  
Full Arena rental is available for a daily flat rate or individual courts and/or track may be rented by the hour. 
Payments Accepted:  SEFCU Arena accepts cash and credit card transactions.  Accepted credit cards are Visa, AmEx, Mastercard and Discover.
